## Goal
- Build a full-stack pizza ordering app that can scale

## Frontend
- The frontend should have two pages (don't worry about auth for now)
- View orders page for store associates to process orders
- Create orders page for customers to submit orders

## Backend
- we are not giving too much away to ensure fairness and not restrict your choice in tech stack
- At minimum
  - it should have a database to store orders
  - it should have api endpoints that allow you to handle requests from the frontend
- What are we looking for?
  - Scalability
  - Maintainability
  - Good Design Patterns


## Bonus
- How would you handle searching, filtering as orders scale globally?
- How does your api handle 1000 requests / sec? 
- How does your database choice handle schema changes?
- How would deployment work?
- How would configuration and secret management work?
- How would you manage infrastructure?
- How would you onboard new developers on to your team?
